    Renders index view. The url accepts a query string with the following
    fields: 
        
        selectby: parameter to which the range is related. Can be either:
            
            *time - The selection is based on hour:minute for one given day.
                   Requires day_for_time field, as the day to which the
                   time is related.

            *date - The selection is based on year/month/day format.

            *all - The graphic shows the entire collection of data. 

        start: start of the range of the selection, in the format specified by
               selectby. 

        end: end of the range of the selection.

        day_for_time: specifies the day on which the time range is applied.
                      Note that even when not needed, the field must by present
                      in the query string (with empty value if you will) or the 
                      graphic won't be shown. 


    If at least one of the required fields is missing, KeyError is handled and
    the template is rendered without graphic. (That applies, thus, to the 
    standard entrance 'loadgraph.arnauorriols.com'). Instead, only the filter
    form is shown, which can be used to specify the data to be shown in the graph.
