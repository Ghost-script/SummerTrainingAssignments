Assignment:
-----------
To write a script that prints the title and the author of every blog posted in http://planet.fedoraproject.org, making use of the virtualenv feature. 

Solution:
---------
As I had already installed python-virtualenv, I've jumpted directly to create a new virual environment::

    $mkdir virtual
    $cd virtual
    $virtualenv virtual_planetparse
    The PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable is not compatible with setuptools. Either use --distribute or unset PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.
