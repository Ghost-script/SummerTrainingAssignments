Personal Introduction
''''''''''''''''''''''''

My real name is Arnau Orriols, from Barcelona, near Spain, Europe. My main calling is pianist, mainly European classical music, just recently graduated from it :D. However, it shares my time with many other passions, such as computing. I started learning programming 2 years ago as one of my degree's courses (yeah, that's right) and since then I've been trying hard to learn more and more everyday.

I started with C++, just the basics, and quickly, as I'm a heavy user of Android, software ideas came to me which drove me to learn Java_ and Android_. If you are ever interested on learning these, they have those awesome tutorials that do really make *most* teachers redundant (As long as they aren't as good as Kushal, of course ;) )

I'm recently wondering what to do next. My standard move should be to continue my piano studies with a masters degree, but this is not convincing enough for me. I feel like linking these two passions and build me a future on both can coexist, maybe `sound and music computing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_and_music_computing>`_, maybe any other option you could imagine. If anyone has any suggestion for me, I would really apreciate it! :D just write an `email`_, find me on `#dgplug`_ or leave a comment at my soon to be inaugurated `blog`_ :)

Course Review
''''''''''''''''''''
So far it's been 2 weeks of dgplug Summer Training Course. Surprisingly enough, this course is made entirely by volunteers, for the sake of linux and the free knowledge distribution. They are a little Linux community based in the city of Durgapur, north-west India. These guys aren't just Linux contributors; they are some of the great masters out there, a full honor to meet them and learn from them. 

So far, though, the course has been quite slow. And that's the  problem with free stuff: people don't take it seriously. If we spend 1 week on learning and debating about etiquette, this is because it's a prime necessity in the community. Comunication is vital, my friends. And with online communities, one should learn that this is still *workplace*, even if you are chatting from your PC, or writting an email. There are procedures you must learn, or you "get fired" (forgive my job reference, it's just explanatory metaphore).

Now after 2 weeks we start learning python. With all the base prepared (VIM, Git, rst) we can now start learning at cruise speed. But people should had taken the firsts 2 weeks seriously, because without these, learning, sharing and enjoying, in this community, can only turn into pain.  

Fins aviat! See you soon!
