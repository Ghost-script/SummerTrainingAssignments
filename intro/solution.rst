   That's why I use the line block

Personal Introduction
''''''''''''''''''''''''

My real name is Arnau Orriols, from Barcelona, near Spain, Europe. My main calling is pianist, mainly European classical music, just recently graduated from it :D. However, it shares my time with many other passions, such as computing. I started learning programming 2 years ago as one of my degree's courses (yeah, that's right) and since then I've been trying hard to learn more and more everyday.

I started with C++, just the basics, and quickly, as I'm a heavy user of Android, software ideas came to me which drove me to learn Java_ and Android_. If you are ever interested on learning these, they have those awesome tutorials that do really make *most* teachers redundant (As long as they aren't as good as Kushal, of course ;) )

I'm recently wondering what to do next. My standard move should be to continue my piano studies with a masters degree, but this is not convincing enought for me. I feel like linking these two passions and build me a future on both can coexist, maybe `sound and music computing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_and_music_computing>`_, maybe any other option you could imagine. If anyone has any suggestion for me, I would really apreciate it! :D just write an `email`_, find me on `#dgplug`_ or leave a comment at my soon to be inaugurated `blog`_ :) 

.. Notice in the last paragraph the diferent links how are they created...
