Many new things and concepts has been introduced this year.

Using various commonly used tools as part of the course work, for example: git and irc.\n2013-07-23 15:02:23\tumesh\tkushal, I felt that the procedure to explain things is very favourable for beginners like us, also it allows us to become self dependent.\n2013-07-23 15:02:28\tkirk_iowa\twhat i have not liked:  some paticularly detailed information might be better provided in prepared docs with *more* step-by-step usage exercises.  This might get people using those tools, that they are unfamiliar with, faster and easier (like git, shell, file system, mail list).\n2013-07-23 15:02:42\tkirk_iowa\tsuggestions: i learn best by doing excercises.  For example: typing them out and going through the processes, and seeing how they work.  We have done that in session numerous times.

found I rather liked the language, and started hanging out on python-list/comp.lang.python and python-dev\n2013-07-17 11:08:49\tncoghlan\tI'm too opinionated to lurk very well, so I started participating actively on both lists rather than just reading\n2013-07-17 11:09:16\tncoghlan\teventually the python-list volume got too much for me to keep up with so, so I don't read that any more :(\n2013-07-17 11:09:59\tncoghlan\taround 2004 I think I submitted my first patch - one of those ones where a mailing list discussion had been spinning on for a while\n2013-07-17 11:10:13\tncoghlan\tand the best way to end it seemed to be to just provide some code\n2013-07-17 11:10:30\tncoghlan\tand thus Python 2.4 came with the -m switch to run a top level module as a script\n2013-07-17 11:10:56\tncoghlan\tand then it took me until Python 2.7 to actually finish making the thing work properly ;)\n2013-07-17 11:11:40\tncoghlan\t(from another point of view, it only *really* works properly in 3.3 - that's the first time it is using the true import system rather than an emulation)\n2013-07-17 11:12:45\tncoghlan\tmy path to becoming a core developer probably isn't one I'd recommend as a general tactic: I got commit privileges by arguing with Guido about a PEP he wrote :)\n2013-07-17 11:13:17\tncoghlan\tthat was PEP 340, his original \"block\" PEP that was... mind-blowing\n2013-07-17 11:13:37\tncoghlan\tincredibly powerful proposal, incredibly mind-bending to try to figure out when and how you would use it\n2013-07-17 11:13:59\t--\trahulch_ is now known as rahulch\n2013-07-17 11:14:23\tncoghlan\tI wasn't the only one who had issues with it, but I was the one who had the time and inclination to write a competing PEP (eventually published on python.org as PEP 436)\n2013-07-17 11:14:35\tncoghlan\terr, 346 rather\n2013-07-17 11:15:10\tncoghlan\tGuido didn't like my specific proposal, but he could see merit in some of the objections\n2013-07-17 11:15:32\tncoghlan\tso he rejected both his own PEP and mine, and we ended up with two other PEPs\n2013-07-17 11:15:44\tncoghlan\tPEP 342, which added the send() and throw() methods to generators\n2013-07-17 11:16:18\tncoghlan\tand one which has consequences most pythonistas will be familiar with: PEP 343, which added context managers and the with statement to the language\n2013-07-17 11:17:22\tncoghlan\tthe way I ended up with commit privileges out of all that, is that Guido gave them to me when PEP 343 needed some significant updates, and he didn't have time to do them himself :)\n2013-07-17 11:18:06\tncoghlan\tit's a roundabout way to get commit privileges, though - most sensible people do it by being active on the issue tracker and providing multple good patches\n2013-07-17 11:18:15\tncoghlan\twithout the \"arguing with Guido\" part :)\n2013-07-17 11:19:01\tncoghlan\the's a very smart fellow and we're lucky to have him as Python's BDFL, but that

11:46:11\tncoghlan\tah, OK - thanks for the clarification\n2013-07-17 11:46:48\tncoghlan\thmm, in some regards it depends on exactly the kinds of problems you're trying to solve\n2013-07-17 11:47:18\tncoghlan\tthe universal elements are being able to *use* things like functions, iterators and context managers effectively\n2013-07-17 11:47:29\tncoghlan\tand classes\n2013-07-17 11:47:39\tncoghlan\tsince most APIs will be built around those four things\n2013-07-17 11:47:59\tncoghlan\tand a lot of the time, what we do as programmers is taking an existing API that solves a problem in general\n2013-07-17 11:48:06\tncoghlan\tand applying it to our particular case\n2013-07-17 11:48:26\tncoghlan\tthe \"next level\" is then learning to create those things ourselves\n2013-07-17 11:48:46\tncoghlan\tsince that provides for more powerful tools for avoid code repetition and that kind of thing\n2013-07-17 11:49:14\tncoghlan\tbeyond that, it's really a matter of honing our *problem solving* skills\n2013-07-17 11:49:25\tncoghlan\tlearning to ask the right questions, learning how to research good answers\n2013-07-17 11:49:58\tncoghlan\tone way to describe

11:56:37\t@kushal\t<navid_> ncoghlan, please talk about test driven development in python, how/at which extent,  you use it in core development?\n2013-07-17 11:57:11\tncoghlan\tso, there's the purist definition of test driven development, which says it has to be test *first* development\n2013-07-17 11:57:30\tncoghlan\tI think that can be a good way to go, especially if you're trying to fix an existing bug\n2013-07-17 11:57:39\tncoghlan\tfirst write a test that fails, then make it pass\n2013-07-17 11:58:18\tncoghlan\thowever, the only rule we enforce in the standard library is that,

beaker-project.org\n2013-07-17 11:58:54\tncoghlan\tthe exceptions are cases where it's not practical to write a robust test\n2013-07-17 11:59:11\tncoghlan\tfragile tests that fail intermittently are

you make even a small change\n2013-07-17 12:00:49\tncoghlan\twhereas with a solid test suite, you can make big changes, confident that the externally visible behaviour will remain the same\n2013-07-17

Dependent Development talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYw2K0_ZZ0w) there\n2013-07-17 12:03:37\tncoghlan\tand one of my points was that if the industry has pretty much figured out that if you're trying to improve a software product\n2013-07-17 12:03:57\tncoghlan\tthen working out how to start building a test suite for it is a key milestone\n2013-07-17 12:04:15\tncoghlan\tbecause getting the test suite in place then gives you the freedom to start fixing everything else\n2013-07-17 12:05:20\tncoghlan\twe're able to make fairly deep changes to CPython (like replacing the whole import system) without most users even noticing when they upgrade\n2013-07-17 12:05:56\tncoghlan\tand it's the regression test suite, and the buildbot fleet that give us the power to do that\n2013-07-17

(unless by some weird chance somebody has an identitical virtualenv with an identical file path)\n2013-07-19 15:22:37\tJ_Caselles\tnormally you would leave the same shebang, #!/usr/bin/env python, and if you have your virtualenv activated, you will be working on this virtualenv, with whichever modules are installed in\n2013-07-19 15:25:05\tkirk_iowa\tJ_Caselles: no you should change your shabang

this?\n2013-07-19 15:33:24\tkirk_iowa\tto use the virtual interpreter you need the path to that virutal interpreter.  if you want to use the system interpreter, you need the path to the system

14:43:08\t@pingou\tthey are a group of libraries that you can use to create an application, the idea is that they make your life easier\n2013-07-25 14:43:42\t@pingou\tflask, pyramid, turbogears, django are example of web framework\n2013-07-25 14:43:55\tmanishjain2792\ta certain type of package that will help to create application, am i right ? pingou.\n2013-07-25 14:43:57\t@pingou\tflask is part of the family of the so-called, micro-framework\n2013-07-25 14:44:22\t@pingou\tmanishjain2792: not a type really, more a set of packages, but yes, the idea is that they help you\n2013-07-25 14:45:08\t@pingou\tmicro-frameworks are basically frameworks with little to no dependencies\n2013-07-25 14:45:29\t@pingou\tin the case of flask, there are only 2: Werkzeug and Jinja\n2013-07-25 14:45:53\t@pingou\twe will see jinja a little bit, but not really Werkzeug (although we will use it, within flask\n2013-07-25 14:45:55\t@pingou\t)\n2013-07-25 14:46:07\tJ_Caselles\t!\n2013-07-25 14:46:08\t@pingou\tlet's start with jinja\n2013-07-25 14:46:12\t@pingou\t> J_Caselles\n2013-07-25 14:46:25\tJ_Caselles\twhat other types of web app framework exists?\n2013-07-25 14:46:51\t@pingou\tJ_Caselles: good question, the other framework are not really named\n2013-07-25 14:47:20\t@pingou\tbasically a framework like TurboGears comes with a lot of dependencies, all well-designed and aiming at helping you\n2013-07-25 14:47:42\t@pingou\thowever it means that you need to keep up with all of them and updating might become challenging :)\n2013-07-25 14:47:59\tJ_Caselles\tnice, thanks <eof>\n2013-07-25 14:48:02\t@pingou\twith only 2 dependencies, flask is much easier to update and follow :)\n2013-07-25 14:48:14\tJ_Caselles\t:)\n2013-07-25 14:48:35\t@pingou\tJ_Caselles: for example, TurboGears imposes how you are connecting to a database\n2013-07-25 14:48:46\t@pingou\t(same thing for Django)\n2013-07-25 14:49:09\t@pingou\tflask does not do anything with databases, it will be up to you to set up your application the way you want it\n2013-07-25 14:49:32\t@pingou\tso sometime micro-framework might give you a little more work when developing\n2013-07-25 14:49:34\tJ_Caselles\tso, it doesn't help you with everything, wich sometimes might be prefered\n2013-07-25 14:50:22\t@pingou\tJ_Caselles: indeed, it basically comes back to a balance between \"all in one\" vs \"freedom to implement the way I want\"\n2013-07-25 14:50:32\tJ_Caselles\tnice\n2013-07-25 14:50:41\t@pingou\tI like the second one :)\n2013-07-25

you set some element as fix and leave some empty, to be filled later on\n2013-07-25 14:53:00\t@pingou\ta bit like a form you fill for an administration\n2013-07-25 14:53:14\t@pingou\tyou have questions and cases for the answer\n2013-07-25 14:53:27\t@pingou\twell in web development you will use template pretty much in the same way\n2013-07-25 14:54:19\t@pingou\texcept that instead of having \"Date of birth: __/__/____\" you will have \"<title>{{title}}</title>\"\n2013-07-25 14:54:45\t@pingou\twhere {{title}} is replaced by what you want\n2013-07-25 14:55:05\t@pingou\tin web application you use the template to set the style of your pages\n2013-07-25 14:55:33\t@pingou\tyou have one main template, which defines the header at the top, the footer at the bottom, the column on the right/left with the menu\n2013-07-25 14:55:49\t@pingou\tand somewhere in the middle you will put the content, content that changes from page to page\n2013-07-25 14:56:02\t@pingou\tdo you follow
