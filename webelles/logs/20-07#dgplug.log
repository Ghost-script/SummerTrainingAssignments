2013-07-20 06:02:41	subho	kushal: just now installed fedora 19. having this error while installing packages. http://fpaste.org/26695/96381137/
2013-07-20 06:06:25	kushal	yum clean all
2013-07-20 06:06:28	kushal	and then try again
2013-07-20 06:06:40	kushal	if possible get a better net connection in the second try
2013-07-20 06:06:47	kushal	it happens time to time
2013-07-20 06:06:58	kushal	if it does not work, then wait for few hours and try again
2013-07-20 06:10:12	subho	kushal: ok. i tried. sudo yum clean all. it didnot work. will try after few hours.
2013-07-20 06:14:02	kushal	that is the best idea
2013-07-20 06:19:31	subho	kushal: asked in #fedora , their method worked. i did "yum clean metadata" then "sudo yum update"
2013-07-20 06:21:51	kushal	subho, :)
