2013-08-01 06:07:14	christi123	praveenkumar, do you have any idea about sockets in python
2013-08-01 06:08:45	praveenkumar	christi123, http://docs.python.org/2/howto/sockets.html and http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm, long back I wrote server stuff using python.
2013-08-01 06:09:47	christi123	praveenkumar, I wrote a python program  to ping a remote machine it shows only one machine is alive while all others are working.
2013-08-01 06:09:57	christi123	I will just paste the link
2013-08-01 06:11:44	christi123	praveenkumar, http://fpaste.org/29395/33709137/
2013-08-01 06:11:52	praveenkumar	christi123, https://bitbucket.org/kumarpraveen/lsync/overview this is what I tried long back.
2013-08-01 06:14:18	christi123	praveenkumar, i will check
2013-08-01 06:14:19	praveenkumar	christi123, check after increasing timeout because sometime due to network delay it may not able to ping
2013-08-01 09:51:19	christi123	hi kushal, I am working with sockets. Port number 80 is defined for web servers. What should i specify as the port number when i connect any other remote machine
2013-08-01 09:52:00	kushal	christi123, depends on that remote machine's port you want to connect
2013-08-01 09:54:09	christi123	kushal, I am trying to ping all the machines in my office by giving IP address as the input and the port number as 135. but it is showing only one machine as alive. but all of them are on.
2013-08-01 09:54:37	kushal	christi123, may be they are blocking ping
2013-08-01 09:55:24	christi123	kushal, does a firewall serve that purpose. Like is the firewall responsible for blocking
2013-08-01 09:55:35	kushal	may be
2013-08-01 09:55:37	dot|not	Could be.
2013-08-01 09:55:43	dot|not	Dang, kushal was faster.
2013-08-01 09:55:44	dot|not	:D
2013-08-01 09:56:10	kushal	dot|not, :D
2013-08-01 09:56:15	kushal	christi123, http://www.g-loaded.eu/2009/10/30/python-ping/
2013-08-01 09:56:20	christi123	kushal, dot|not, ok Thankyou
2013-08-01 09:56:50	dot|not	I still find it disturbing that some administrators block ICMP Echo-Requests for security reasons..
2013-08-01 11:34:55	christi123	how to disable  firewall on fedora18
2013-08-01 11:36:42	kushal	christi123, type the same question on google.com
2013-08-01 11:37:21	christi123	kushal, I tried it out. http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/turn-on-turn-off-firewall-in-linux/
2013-08-01 11:37:29	kushal	same here
2013-08-01 11:37:33	kushal	service iptables top
2013-08-01 11:37:36	kushal	stop
2013-08-01 11:37:50	christi123	But when i executed it said no no file or directory
2013-08-01 11:41:23	kushal	show us
2013-08-01 11:41:26	kushal	fpaste
2013-08-01 11:42:54	praveenkumar	christi123, check "systemctl stop iptables.service" even "service iptables stop" also work as kushal pointed out.
2013-08-01 11:43:23	christi123	kushal, praveenkumar Thanks it worked
2013-08-01 11:44:26	praveenkumar	christi123, one question, why you want to stop firewall (iptable service)?
2013-08-01 11:45:44	dot|not	Because the knowledge to modify rules accordingly is missing. *SCNR*
2013-08-01 11:46:18	christi123	praveenkumar, actually my socket program isn't working on some machines. i.e i am not able to connect to them hence i am trying to disable the firewall and try running it
2013-08-01 11:47:58	amresh	dot|not: what is *scnr* ? (scnr :P)
2013-08-01 11:48:50	praveenkumar	christi123, you can add a particular port to firewall so that it will go through, instead of disabling it.
2013-08-01 11:49:21	christi123	praveenkumar, ok i will try that too
2013-08-01 11:49:30	praveenkumar	ok
2013-08-01 11:49:48	dot|not	Even though it does not really make a difference for desktop machines ..
2013-08-01 11:53:41	christi123	kushal, It worked thanks :)
2013-08-01 12:24:42	J_Caselles	hi
2013-08-01 12:24:57	J_Caselles	kushal: I'm about to finish dup_images, but I'm stuck
2013-08-01 12:25:11	kushal	J_Caselles, what happened ?
2013-08-01 12:25:25	J_Caselles	I know it was not asked, but I want to implement recursive option as others have, I find it nice option
2013-08-01 12:26:59	J_Caselles	but then I can't figure how to mix this which having more t'han one folder searced recursively and check that the user doesn't do "dup_images -R /home/me/pics /home/me/pics/ofme"
2013-08-01 12:27:46	J_Caselles	how to avoid searching a dir if it is a child of another one
2013-08-01 12:28:10	J_Caselles	Maybe I'm just sick of thinking :/
2013-08-01 12:28:33	J_Caselles	I may post without recursive and add it to the TODO list :D
2013-08-01 12:32:31	praveenkumar	J_Caselles, I think initially you can do without recursive option. but if you want to do a recursive option then os.walk will give a tuple which contain path, dir and files for a given directory
2013-08-01 12:32:42	amresh	J_Caselles: when you do a recursive search, and prepare a list of jpg file. you can store absolute addresses. which will enable you to find duplicate entries in that list. so you can remove this problem.
2013-08-01 12:33:31	praveenkumar	amresh, here absolute address mean absolute path right?
2013-08-01 12:33:50	amresh	praveenkumar: yes with ref. to /
2013-08-01 12:34:12	praveenkumar	yes right.
2013-08-01 12:34:39	amresh	J_Caselles: i must have tried this as well :(
2013-08-01 12:34:55	praveenkumar	amresh, so here we are only considering .jpg extension what about .png and .gif ..etc.
2013-08-01 12:35:30	amresh	praveenkumar: kushal asked for jpg only.
2013-08-01 12:35:38	praveenkumar	ok
2013-08-01 12:36:28	kushal	oh while giving the question I should have mentioned that a/b means all directories under b :)
2013-08-01 12:36:35	kushal	 /home/kushal/pics
2013-08-01 12:36:46	kushal	   ^^^^^^^ will contain all directories
2013-08-01 12:37:16	praveenkumar	kushal, great, so now I also have to change my code :)
2013-08-01 13:01:09	m0rin09m`	who is rahulc93? it's good to learn how to construct nesting loop in python way.
2013-08-01 13:04:31	m0rin09m`	Armageddon: thanks for showing us cool features of python. e.g. with statement, lambda function, generator, etc...
2013-08-01 13:04:52	m0rin09m`	good to know
2013-08-01 13:05:05	J_Caselles	sorry sorry thank you all, I'll read you nice comments in a moment!!
2013-08-01 13:11:47	J_Caselles	ok guys
2013-08-01 13:13:28	J_Caselles	well, actually I thought I had solved the problem with listdir(set(listofdirs)) (I'm using listdir for a reason, dont ask :D)
2013-08-01 13:14:10	J_Caselles	but somehow /home/me/pics != /home/me/pics
2013-08-01 13:19:02	m0rin09m`	J_Caselles: it seems you are having a fun. keep it up!
2013-08-01 13:33:15	J_Caselles	it's a pity I don't have time to review other's code :/
2013-08-01 13:33:31	praveenkumar	iam_sudip, ping
2013-08-01 13:35:14	J_Caselles	btw, I'm prowd of me using setdefault, easy way to check for duplicates :D
2013-08-01 13:35:51	iam_sudip	praveenkumar: o_O?
2013-08-01 13:36:32	J_Caselles	and I have stick to the plan, if there's no exif, there's no image :P
2013-08-01 13:36:54	J_Caselles	see you later!! have a nice session, I can't attend
2013-08-01 13:37:03	kushal	J_Caselles, bye :)
2013-08-01 13:38:02	praveenkumar	iam_sudip, you used messy stuff in your code, like instead of key, value you used pair and then pair[1] :) which will contain value right?
2013-08-01 13:38:57	kushal	we should do sessions on clean code
2013-08-01 13:39:06	kushal	but only after 2 weeks
2013-08-01 13:39:13	kushal	see you all at 7
2013-08-01 13:39:45	iam_sudip	praveenkumar: yes. you are right.
2013-08-01 13:40:25	iam_sudip	It will contain the hash generated previously for each file. corresponding to pair[0] is the name of the file.
2013-08-01 13:42:55	iam_sudip	i found pair is good cause this 'pair' i wanted to mean that i am retrieving one file and hash and doing the checking.
2013-08-01 13:43:46	iam_sudip	honestly i found kinda same code in stackoverflow and i liked it for this purpose, so i used.
2013-08-01 13:44:04	iam_sudip	btw, the code is good? praveenkumar ?
2013-08-01 13:45:54	praveenkumar	iam_sudip, I found some fault in logic also, just think instead of using absolute file path as a key you could have use md5sum value as a key and whenever other file which have same md5sum occur you could have tell directly there it's duplicate
2013-08-01 13:46:48	praveenkumar	iam_sudip, now you are making a another dict for storing same md5sum files in list and then printing.
2013-08-01 13:47:15	iam_sudip	praveenkumar: no
2013-08-01 13:47:35	iam_sudip	the other dictionary will contain the hash as key
2013-08-01 13:47:46	iam_sudip	and the list of duplicates as value
2013-08-01 13:48:37	iam_sudip	first dictionary was the simple one that have key=file, value=hash
2013-08-01 13:49:36	iam_sudip	so in the new dictionary(as arranged_data) there will be no same hash value.
2013-08-01 13:50:13	praveenkumar	iam_sudip, yes what I want to say even from first time only you can do that no need to create arrange_data dict.
2013-08-01 13:51:25	iam_sudip	oh! yes. then the coding will be less. (y)
2013-08-01 13:51:38	praveenkumar	something like "if !data[hashlib.md5(open(str(path_to_file)).read()).hexdigest()] then store file path as value
2013-08-01 13:51:45	praveenkumar	correct
2013-08-01 13:52:30	iam_sudip	yes. understood. :)
2013-08-01 13:52:46	praveenkumar	great.
2013-08-01 13:53:32	iam_sudip	praveenkumar: thanks for review.
2013-08-01 13:53:45	praveenkumar	welcome
2013-08-01 14:04:56	praveenkumar	kavis_1, ping
2013-08-01 14:05:03	--	rahulch_ is now known as rahulch
2013-08-01 14:05:28	kavis_1	praveenkumar, pong
2013-08-01 14:07:40	praveenkumar	kavis_1, in check_for_duplicate() function, don't you think even same image is compared by itself?
2013-08-01 14:10:05	kavis_1	praveenkumar, in if ((n[1] == x[1] and n[0] != x[0]) or (n[1] != x[1]))  i have check the name of the file if n[1] != x[1] then only the file is duplicate
2013-08-01 14:10:09	kavis_1	:)
2013-08-01 14:10:52	dot|not	Code in IRC is unbelievably ugly.
2013-08-01 14:10:56	kavis_1	list n contain name of image file and its location at index 1 and 0 and same with x
2013-08-01 14:11:52	praveenkumar	kavis_1, yes but still you are executing some part of the function without any desire stuff.
2013-08-01 14:12:48	praveenkumar	kavis_1, ok, have to go home, ping you later.
2013-08-01 14:15:21	kavis_1	praveenkumar, i was trying to remove the file from list that caught duplicate but it is of use for next directory because same name file can reside in other directories
2013-08-01 14:15:38	kavis_1	praveenkumar, ah ok :)
2013-08-01 14:29:04	praveenkumar	kavis_1, you didn't push your code change to github?
2013-08-01 14:29:28	kavis_1	praveenkumar, i did
2013-08-01 14:29:29	praveenkumar	kavis_1, I didn't see git url in blog post, may be you missed it
2013-08-01 14:29:43	praveenkumar	to mention it there
2013-08-01 14:29:49	kavis_1	praveenkumar, hmm
2013-08-01 14:29:59	kavis_1	praveenkumar, missed
2013-08-01 14:30:09	praveenkumar	alright
2013-08-01 14:31:20	praveenkumar	kavis_1, I don't know why you used "os.path.join(r,files)" in search method because you didn't use it anywhere
2013-08-01 14:33:21	kavis_1	praveenkumar, sorry i forget to remove it i was doing alot of experiments thats why :)
2013-08-01 14:33:32	kavis_1	praveenkumar, it is of no use
2013-08-01 14:33:43	praveenkumar	that's ok
2013-08-01 14:35:18	praveenkumar	kavis_1, now come to check_for_duplicate function, what you think a best way to avoid unnecessary code run without changing the logic?
2013-08-01 14:35:47	praveenkumar	kavis_1, take your time, I also need to think :)
2013-08-01 14:37:37	kavis_1	praveenkumar,  by removing that file which already caught duplicate from the list x , i think
2013-08-01 14:40:07	praveenkumar	kavis_1, don't you think there may be more that 2 file which are duplicate and if you remove when first duplicate occur then how you handle other one?
2013-08-01 14:41:41	praveenkumar	kirk_iowa ping, are you iowabeakster?
2013-08-01 14:42:35	praveenkumar	who is iowabeakster?
2013-08-01 14:43:25	kushal	sorry for being late
2013-08-01 14:43:27	kushal	now we have only 40 nicks in the channel
2013-08-01 14:43:29	kushal	praveenkumar, kirk_iowa
2013-08-01 14:43:31	kushal	:)
2013-08-01 14:43:49	kirk_iowa	yes
2013-08-01 14:44:00	kirk_iowa	sorry was getting coffee
2013-08-01 14:44:18	kirk_iowa	praveenkumar: yes i am
2013-08-01 14:44:24	kushal	lets do a roll call
2013-08-01 14:44:29	praveenkumar	kirk_iowa, ok you should take care of your comments,

2013-08-01 14:45:03	kavis_1	kavis khandelwal
2013-08-01 14:45:19	praveenkumar	kavis_1, will discuss after session
2013-08-01 14:45:20	kirk_iowa	kirk gunderson
2013-08-01 14:45:57	kushal	ok
2013-08-01 14:45:57	sonam	sonam
2013-08-01 14:45:58	kavis_1	praveenkumar, :)
2013-08-01 14:47:37	kushal	so, for the next two weeks
2013-08-01 14:47:45	kushal	we build a small web app
2013-08-01 14:48:00	kushal	we will start small and then slowly go over
2013-08-01 14:49:32	kushal	we will use flask
2013-08-01 14:49:42	kushal	if anyone missed, he/she can read http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/flask.html as a start
2013-08-01 14:50:30	kushal	now the first task
2013-08-01 14:51:19	kushal	everyone, create a new directory in their git, call it logviewer
2013-08-01 14:52:42	kushal	in the index page (/) of the app, it will show different available logs, to start just show by log names
2013-08-01 14:52:45	shantanu	Shantanu Sarkar
2013-08-01 14:53:11	kushal	by clicking the log name, it will open a new page which will show the log
2013-08-01 14:53:25	kushal	so the urls will look like
2013-08-01 14:54:47	kushal	http://localhost:8000/ -- > will show all logs
2013-08-01 14:55:14	kushal	http://localhost:8000/log/id_of_the_log --> will show the actual log
2013-08-01 14:55:55	kushal	in the source directory, create a directory called "posts"
2013-08-01 14:56:18	kushal	and inside keep some training logs
2013-08-01 14:56:45	kushal	point to remember: logs should be kept not just as plain text file
2013-08-01 14:57:19	kushal	but something like a json file, where you can store, log name, date-time, full log text etc
2013-08-01 14:57:34	kirk_iowa	!
2013-08-01 14:57:36	kushal	kirk_iowa, ask
2013-08-01 14:58:30	kirk_iowa	my logs (say of #dgplug channel) are one continuous file.  is that a problem?  do i need to break it up into daily pieces, for example ?
2013-08-01 14:59:16	kushal	kirk_iowa, break it up, this is just home task so not have to be full classes, but just first 20-50 lines from each class
2013-08-01 14:59:24	kushal	kirk_iowa, or you can just download them from dgplug site
2013-08-01 14:59:33	kushal	it can be any year
2013-08-01 14:59:40	kirk_iowa	ok
2013-08-01 15:03:07	kushal	http://paste.fedoraproject.org/29482/ shows one way to store data
2013-08-01 15:04:19	kushal	so, you have to design the store of data first
2013-08-01 15:04:38	kushal	and then write some script/something to save some data in the store
2013-08-01 15:04:48	kushal	and then start working on the web app
2013-08-01 15:05:05	kushal	and you should discuss your ideas with others here
2013-08-01 15:05:49	kushal	now any question ?
2013-08-01 15:06:24	kushal	it is always better to write a separate module which will handle saving of data
2013-08-01 15:07:35	kushal	any question on the given problem ?
2013-08-01 15:07:38	kushal	anyone ?
2013-08-01 15:08:25	amresh	kushal: !
2013-08-01 15:08:30	kushal	amresh, ask
2013-08-01 15:08:39	amresh	kushal: how many days for this ?
2013-08-01 15:09:21	kushal	amresh, we will do the full app in around 2 weeks
2013-08-01 15:09:51	kushal	amresh, coming Monday I will give next set of features on this app
2013-08-01 15:10:02	kushal	so one should be ready by then
2013-08-01 15:10:28	kushal	btw, after 15th we will do sessions on code reviews
2013-08-01 15:10:31	kushal	formally :)
2013-08-01 15:10:57	 *	kushal thanks praveenkumar for doing great reviews :)

2013-08-01 15:11:27	kushal	btw, you don't have to submit any code
2013-08-01 15:11:37	kirk_iowa	!
2013-08-01 15:11:40	kushal	rather do not submit any code
2013-08-01 15:11:45	kushal	just push to your github
2013-08-01 15:11:47	kushal	kirk_iowa, ask
2013-08-01 15:11:52	christi123	!
2013-08-01 15:12:14	kushal	christi123, ask
2013-08-01 15:12:20	kirk_iowa	in your example i do no understand "'text':'<a>: Hello\n<b>: Bye'", what is it that this represents ?
2013-08-01 15:12:21	christi123	Are you talking about the present assignment or the previous ones
2013-08-01 15:12:37	christi123	That do not submit
2013-08-01 15:12:41	 *	praveenkumar says kushal: welcome, btw I am also learning stuff from different members code.
2013-08-01 15:12:58	kushal	christi123, present one, today's
2013-08-01 15:13:06	kushal	kirk_iowa, that is the actual log
2013-08-01 15:13:11	christi123	kushal, ok thanks
2013-08-01 15:13:16	kushal	kirk_iowa, a said Hello, b said bye :p
2013-08-01 15:13:30	kirk_iowa	ok
2013-08-01 15:13:50	anuragk	!
2013-08-01 15:13:55	kushal	kirk_iowa, logs can be a dictionary
2013-08-01 15:14:09	kushal	anuragk, ask
2013-08-01 15:14:34	anuragk	you have to design the store of data : what is the store here?
2013-08-01 15:14:39	kirk_iowa	:) i see... i am starting to understand why dictionaries are so popular with the python crowd.
2013-08-01 15:15:26	kushal	anuragk, store means where you will keep the all data
2013-08-01 15:16:20	anuragk	the json file ?
2013-08-01 15:17:35	praveenkumar	anuragk, to a json file
2013-08-01 15:19:13	anuragk	ok
2013-08-01 15:19:45	kushal	---------SESSION ENDS----------
2013-08-01 15:19:48	kushal	speak freely
2013-08-01 15:20:11	 *	praveenkumar goes for dinner :)
2013-08-01 15:20:26	rahulch	kushal, when will we be getting projects?
2013-08-01 15:20:45	amresh	rahulch: this is a project :)
2013-08-01 15:20:48	kushal	rahulch, what you think today's problem ?
2013-08-01 15:20:57	rahulch	kushal, okay :)
2013-08-01 15:21:02	kushal	not a political rally at least
2013-08-01 15:21:20	praveenkumar	:)
2013-08-01 15:22:27	kirk_iowa	kushal: should our "log storing script" be somtething that is fully automated ?
2013-08-01 15:23:59	kushal	kirk_iowa, nah
2013-08-01 15:24:18	kushal	kirk_iowa, say a module and then command which uses that module to add a new log to the json store
2013-08-01 15:25:50	 *	kirk_iowa thinks that sounds easier ^^
2013-08-01 15:26:35	amresh	kushal: won't it be easy to create a json file manually ? just a matter of few brackets !!
2013-08-01 15:27:46	kushal	amresh, no, think about a json file which is 10MB or 100MB :)
2013-08-01 15:29:26	amresh	kushal: so we use python mostly for automation work, right ?
2013-08-01 15:29:56	amresh	in problems where nothing else can come up as a quick-fix :)
2013-08-01 15:30:26	kirk_iowa	amresh: or imagine you are creating an web app that might store thousands of small logs ?  it might be nice to create many at once ?
2013-08-01 15:31:39	amresh	kirk_iowa: :) again a quick-fix to automation issue
2013-08-01 15:34:44	elita15	kushal,for the hometask  do we only need to create a json store having some logs using the given method?
2013-08-01 15:35:33	kushal	elita15, no, you have to write code also
2013-08-01 15:35:59	 *	amresh leaves for home
2013-08-01 15:39:29	elita15	kushal, can you please tell what do we have to write the code? is it for creating a json store using the given method and displaying each log?
2013-08-01 15:40:21	kushal	elita15, I already told
2013-08-01 15:40:29	kushal	someone else please help elita15
2013-08-01 15:41:10	elita15	kushal, okay  i'll find out, actually i had lost connection.
2013-08-01 15:41:54	kushal	elita15, ok

2013-08-01 23:02:49	J_Caselles	Armageddon ping
2013-08-01 23:12:45	J_Caselles	m0rin09m` ping
2013-08-01 23:31:49	Armageddon	J_Caselles, pong
2013-08-01 23:36:59	J_Caselles	how are you?
2013-08-01 23:37:11	J_Caselles	you are not talking much lately
2013-08-01 23:41:05	J_Caselles	kavish never read PEP8 :/
2013-08-01 23:43:08	Armageddon	who's kavish ?
2013-08-01 23:43:10	J_Caselles	well, it doesn't even run, has typo
2013-08-01 23:43:15	Armageddon	btw I've had a lot of beers
2013-08-01 23:43:18	Armageddon	so I'm not 100% with you :p
2013-08-01 23:43:21	J_Caselles	hahahaha
2013-08-01 23:43:23	J_Caselles	good for you
2013-08-01 23:43:40	Armageddon	I've been drinking since 1opm
2013-08-01 23:43:43	Armageddon	1pm*
2013-08-01 23:43:49	J_Caselles	oh man
2013-08-01 23:43:49	Armageddon	it's 7 now :p
2013-08-01 23:44:04	J_Caselles	and why is that?
2013-08-01 23:44:41	Armageddon	cause I'm celebrating :D
2013-08-01 23:44:45	Armageddon	and cause why not
2013-08-01 23:44:56	J_Caselles	celebrating what?
2013-08-01 23:46:23	J_Caselles	lol
2013-08-01 23:47:20	J_Caselles	kavisk was telling me how to use os.walk... but his code (even the one at github) doesn't even run :D
2013-08-01 23:48:27	Armageddon	how about mine ?
2013-08-01 23:48:35	J_Caselles	I'm not arrived yet
2013-08-01 23:48:41	J_Caselles	kirk's is also wrong
2013-08-01 23:48:49	Armageddon	mine works awesomly
2013-08-01 23:48:57	J_Caselles	will find **every** file duplicate :D
2013-08-01 23:48:59	Armageddon	os.walk here's what it does
2013-08-01 23:49:11	Armageddon	it gives you a list of lists of 3 tuples
2013-08-01 23:49:11	J_Caselles	no, I now
2013-08-01 23:49:18	J_Caselles	don't explain again please
2013-08-01 23:49:19	J_Caselles	haha
2013-08-01 23:49:21	Armageddon	the first is the path to the directly
2013-08-01 23:49:34	Armageddon	the second is what directories are there in the current directory
2013-08-01 23:49:37	Armageddon	and the third are the files
2013-08-01 23:49:39	Armageddon	that's it
2013-08-01 23:50:04	J_Caselles	I knew before also, I asked a completely different question, he thought explaining os.walk was the answer :D
2013-08-01 23:50:19	Armageddon	what was the question?
2013-08-01 23:50:25	Armageddon	I might be able to answer it
2013-08-01 23:51:29	J_Caselles	not really a question, I wanted to use --recursive option, but was searching for a way of prevent the user searching recursively a parent and a child of this parent:
2013-08-01 23:51:43	J_Caselles	dup_images /home/me /home/me/myself
2013-08-01 23:53:10	Armageddon	I don't like recursive functions
2013-08-01 23:53:19	Armageddon	I tend to use them as less as possible, they are bad practice
2013-08-01 23:53:46	J_Caselles	well, in this case seemed like a nice option to have
2013-08-01 23:53:56	Armageddon	not really
2013-08-01 23:54:11	Armageddon	they are a nice option to have in a limited number of iterations
2013-08-01 23:54:19	Armageddon	in this case, you don't know how many files there are/will be
2013-08-01 23:54:36	Armageddon	if you have let's say a 1000 good luck trying to crunch those, you'll get a buffer overflow
2013-08-01 23:55:47	Armageddon	actually stack overflow
2013-08-01 23:57:20	J_Caselles	haha
2013-08-01 23:57:23	J_Caselles	weeell
2013-08-01 23:57:43	J_Caselles	at least one code that "works": m0rin09m`
2013-08-01 23:58:10	Armageddon	J_Caselles, that's why I didn't use a recursive
2013-08-01 23:58:21	Armageddon	you use a recursive with a very limited parameters
2013-08-01 23:58:24	J_Caselles	but it's output could be better, because only finds duplicate pairs
2013-08-01 23:58:54	J_Caselles	Armageddon: actually I've quit of recursive option, haven't implement it :D
2013-08-01 23:59:02	Armageddon	no I'm explaining why
2013-08-01 23:59:13	Armageddon	I could've used it, if I wanted to but I didn't for this reason
2013-08-01 23:59:22	Armageddon	I was testing mine on hundreds of files
2013-08-01 23:59:29	Armageddon	and I can guarantee that it works premo
2013-08-01 23:59:40	J_Caselles	(I was talking about m0rin09m`
2013-08-01 23:59:58	J_Caselles	ok, I trust you ;)
