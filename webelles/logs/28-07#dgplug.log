2013-07-28 00:13:05	Armageddon	J_Caselles, how about we write out own APIs ?
2013-07-28 00:13:07	Armageddon	simplistic
2013-07-28 00:13:13	Armageddon	we take what's good from each of the APIs
2013-07-28 00:16:19	Armageddon	J_Caselles, whatcha think ?
2013-07-28 00:28:52	J_Caselles	sound fun
2013-07-28 00:29:10	J_Caselles	haha
2013-07-28 00:29:34	J_Caselles	it's clear we use user/password
2013-07-28 00:29:37	J_Caselles	isn't it?
2013-07-28 00:34:14	Armageddon	that's what he said
2013-07-28 01:10:40	Armageddon	J_Caselles, or we can take only what's necessary from it :p
2013-07-28 01:16:20	J_Caselles	you want proxy
2013-07-28 01:16:34	J_Caselles	but why not using oauth?
2013-07-28 01:16:51	J_Caselles	user/password is deprecated
2013-07-28 01:17:48	J_Caselles	http://www.fpaste.org/28342/
2013-07-28 01:33:53	Armageddon	J_Caselles, he said somewhere you need to know where to put your username and pass
2013-07-28 01:42:32	J_Caselles	ok...
2013-07-28 01:44:33	J_Caselles	but I've already made my twitter tool using oauth
2013-07-28 01:46:18	Armageddon	does it use proxy ? :p
2013-07-28 01:46:25	Armageddon	I don't mind using oauth
2013-07-28 01:46:36	Armageddon	I just want to use proxy as well, optionally
2013-07-28 01:46:44	Armageddon	I'll use proxy to test it
2013-07-28 01:47:48	J_Caselles	haven't seen it so far
2013-07-28 01:48:02	J_Caselles	are you @ThyArmageddon?
2013-07-28 01:48:12	Armageddon	yes I am
2013-07-28 01:48:24	Armageddon	I just don't share it
2013-07-28 01:48:41	Armageddon	it's the hidden side of me :p
2013-07-28 01:49:05	J_Caselles	hahahaha
2013-07-28 01:49:11	J_Caselles	why?
2013-07-28 01:49:17	Armageddon	pom
2013-07-28 01:49:18	Armageddon	pm
2013-07-28 02:08:05	iam_sudip	there is a simple bug in fbconsole.py.
2013-07-28 02:08:25	Armageddon	fb as in facebook ?
2013-07-28 02:08:37	iam_sudip	yes.
2013-07-28 02:08:41	Armageddon	actually turns out that wasn't me on twitter lol
2013-07-28 02:08:45	Armageddon	I forgot my account
2013-07-28 02:08:50	Armageddon	bahahaha but J_Caselles has the actual account
2013-07-28 02:08:57	Armageddon	iam_sudip, what does facebook have to do with anything ?
2013-07-28 02:09:00	Armageddon	it's twitter
2013-07-28 02:09:20	iam_sudip	no i do not use twitter so i tried the assignment in facebook.
2013-07-28 02:09:35	Armageddon	twitter is much cooler
2013-07-28 02:09:39	Armageddon	it's the cool people
2013-07-28 02:10:37	iam_sudip	don't know, whatever, i just dont like fb, twitter. but for friends i use facebook.
2013-07-28 02:10:57	Armageddon	I use both
2013-07-28 02:11:00	Armageddon	incognito :p
2013-07-28 02:11:18	Armageddon	but that's my private stuff, I don't share them
2013-07-28 02:11:33	iam_sudip	yeah! you are very concern about your PRIVACY.
2013-07-28 02:12:16	iam_sudip	i know that. so it is obvious that you will ans surely use proxies.
2013-07-28 02:12:26	iam_sudip	*and
2013-07-28 02:12:27	Armageddon	or use my server
2013-07-28 02:12:57	iam_sudip	"use my server" means?
2013-07-28 02:13:20	Armageddon	test everything from my sever not my computer :/
2013-07-28 02:15:02	iam_sudip	good.
2013-07-28 02:15:02	Armageddon	I'd prefer proxy though
2013-07-28 02:15:17	Armageddon	I might end up editing the libraries
2013-07-28 02:17:16	iam_sudip	in my case the api randomly returns http://fpaste.org/28345/37497406/ or sometimes it's working fine.
2013-07-28 02:17:40	Armageddon	in my case I haven't started yet :p
2013-07-28 02:18:56	Armageddon	J_Caselles, tweetpy is the best one
2013-07-28 02:20:41	iam_sudip	btw i will try tweetpy for making the twitter app. though i took a glance on it yesterday before i started to make the app for facebbok.
2013-07-28 02:20:58	J_Caselles	don't know
2013-07-28 02:21:20	J_Caselles	too many people using tweetpy... I wanna be different man
2013-07-28 02:21:38	J_Caselles	TweetPony sound cooler
2013-07-28 02:22:06	iam_sudip	J_Caselles: make your own API. :)
2013-07-28 02:22:56	Armageddon	J_Caselles, I was checking it out actually
2013-07-28 02:23:21	J_Caselles	Armageddon: twython is the one

2013-07-28 02:29:09	J_Caselles	yes
2013-07-28 02:29:16	J_Caselles	easy
2013-07-28 02:29:30	J_Caselles	fast, token given in just one click
2013-07-28 02:29:38	Armageddon	yea I know that

2013-07-28 17:42:46	J_Caselles3	Kushal told me he prefers user/password
2013-07-28 17:42:50	J_Caselles3	:(
2013-07-28 17:43:03	Armageddon	J_Caselles3, prefers, doesn't mean he wants you to use that method
2013-07-28 17:43:10	zishan	Armageddon, i have made the package including facebook, but it is not installing using pip, however it works fine when installed manually
2013-07-28 17:43:19	J_Caselles3	Oh, ok :D
2013-07-28 17:43:43	Armageddon	a preference is not a mendatory thing :p
2013-07-28 17:43:48	Armageddon	that's how I look at it
2013-07-28 17:45:12	zishan	Armageddon, what's the reason behind this type of error
2013-07-28 17:45:15	J_Caselles3	Well, I wanted to fork twython and add this tweepy functionality, but understanding tweepy code was too much for little time
2013-07-28 17:45:34	Armageddon	zishan, wrong setup.py
2013-07-28 17:45:54	zishan	what's wrong , please explain me
2013-07-28 17:46:12	Armageddon	zishan, I'm a lot of things, a mind reader is not one of them
2013-07-28 17:46:34	Armageddon	nor a psychic either
2013-07-28 17:47:32	J_Caselles3	Armageddon where would you store the user/password file?
2013-07-28 17:48:01	Armageddon	J_Caselles3, you mean in linux ?
2013-07-28 17:48:05	J_Caselles3	~/.file ?
2013-07-28 17:48:19	Armageddon	either .apprc
2013-07-28 17:48:29	Armageddon	or .confing/app/config
2013-07-28 17:48:47	J_Caselles3	In home?
2013-07-28 17:49:35	Armageddon	rc is designates config file
2013-07-28 17:49:51	Armageddon	so .J_Caselles3rc is the configuration file of J_Caselles3
2013-07-28 17:50:06	Armageddon	btw that was .config not .confing :p
2013-07-28 17:53:05	rahulch	Armageddon, found any module for twitter ?
2013-07-28 17:53:10	Armageddon	rahulch, lots :p
2013-07-28 17:53:19	rahulch	nice :P
2013-07-28 17:53:39	rahulch	what are you using?
2013-07-28 17:53:48	Armageddon	https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries
2013-07-28 17:53:54	Armageddon	one of those ^ :p
2013-07-28 17:55:29	rahulch	nice :D
2013-07-28 17:59:18	J_Caselles3	Armageddon, yes, I was wondering maybe in other partition
2013-07-28 17:59:30	Armageddon	J_Caselles3, no
2013-07-28 17:59:49	J_Caselles3	Ok :D
2013-07-28 17:59:55	Armageddon	terminal apps use .configrc
2013-07-28 18:00:07	Armageddon	gui apps use .config/app/configg
2013-07-28 18:07:23	rahulch	Armageddon, could not find a decent documentation for those packages
2013-07-28 18:07:35	Armageddon	google :p
2013-07-28 18:07:40	Armageddon	and ask J_Caselles3
2013-07-28 18:07:40	Armageddon	:p
2013-07-28 18:07:49	Armageddon	he's my goto guy for docs
2013-07-28 18:08:14	rahulch	J_Caselles3, some help? :P
2013-07-28 18:08:27	rahulch	Armageddon, :D
2013-07-28 18:08:39	Armageddon	which one do you need to find docs for ?
2013-07-28 18:08:51	Armageddon	just google it with docs
2013-07-28 18:09:09	rahulch	I was thinking of TweetPony or PythonTwitterTools
2013-07-28 18:09:23	rahulch	yes googling :)
2013-07-28 18:09:24	J_Caselles3	There isn't much to docu though
2013-07-28 18:09:29	rahulch	exactly
2013-07-28 18:09:47	J_Caselles3	They are pretty straighforward
2013-07-28 18:10:19	J_Caselles3	You're best chance is to help()
2013-07-28 18:10:56	rahulch	agreed
2013-07-28 18:10:58	J_Caselles3	There're only a couple of them with bast docu
2013-07-28 18:11:00	rahulch	thanks anyways :)
2013-07-28 18:11:30	J_Caselles3	Twython and tweepy
2013-07-28 18:12:20	rahulch	tweepy does not have anything for tweeting images btw, I guess
2013-07-28 18:12:46	J_Caselles3	But the other ones have less docu because they have nothing more to document
2013-07-28 18:12:59	J_Caselles3	Tweepy does tweet pics afaik
2013-07-28 18:13:39	rahulch	then i skipped it :( have to read more
2013-07-28 18:15:09	J_Caselles3	They have their own website, from there you'll find their great documentarion (sorry not in laptop at the moment)
2013-07-28 18:15:55	rahulch	is it this one? http://pythonhosted.org/tweepy/html/
2013-07-28 18:16:07	Armageddon	http://pythonhosted.org/tweepy/html/
2013-07-28 18:16:19	Armageddon	they don't have picture upload afaik
2013-07-28 18:16:27	rahulch	Armageddon, +1
2013-07-28 18:18:36	Armageddon	I'm thinking of writing the code for the script sloppy and fast to get it done with :p
2013-07-28 18:19:09	Armageddon	I don't want to lose time on that to be honest
2013-07-28 18:19:53	Armageddon	I love iam_sudip he didn't even bother writing anything
2013-07-28 18:20:32	Armageddon	or did he :/
2013-07-28 18:20:38	rahulch	iam_sudip and sheeshmohsin did for FB btw
2013-07-28 18:21:23	Armageddon	where's the code ?
2013-07-28 18:21:35	Armageddon	no code, no link, no nothing
2013-07-28 18:21:57	rahulch	check their github repos
2013-07-28 18:21:57	iam_sudip	Armageddon: I did first at 26th. on fb. I said I do not use twitter so I did for facebook.
2013-07-28 18:22:18	Armageddon	it should be in the solution.rst
2013-07-28 18:23:35	iam_sudip	I was sleepy that time when I wrote finished the code. So I forgot. If you need I can give you here. https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/tweetup
2013-07-28 18:23:58	iam_sudip	s/wrote finished/finished/
2013-07-28 18:23:59	+batul	What iam_sudip meant to say was: I was sleepy that time when I finished the code. So I forgot. If you need I can give you here. https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/tweetup
2013-07-28 18:24:46	Armageddon	you uploaded the tar.gz to github ? :/
2013-07-28 18:25:12	rahulch	:D
2013-07-28 18:25:17	iam_sudip	yes. any thing wrong? let me know.
2013-07-28 18:25:46	pingou	putting a tarbal into a git repo isn't always the best idea
2013-07-28 18:27:01	Armageddon	iam_sudip, yes, everything is wrong with it
2013-07-28 18:27:45	iam_sudip	pingou:  ok i will remember from now. :)
2013-07-28 18:27:52	Armageddon	you don't push a tarball to git repo (except in minor cases)
2013-07-28 18:28:17	Armageddon	I can't look at the code for example
2013-07-28 18:31:03	iam_sudip	Armageddon: Ok. Can you test it? I messed something I think. let me know if it's installing correctly.
2013-07-28 18:31:15	Armageddon	no, I can't test it
2013-07-28 18:31:36	iam_sudip	Armageddon: Ok. no problem. :)
2013-07-28 18:31:47	Armageddon	it doesn't have proxy settings
2013-07-28 18:32:05	iam_sudip	Oh! I forgot. :p
2013-07-28 18:32:47	iam_sudip	btw, I was reading for it. Willing to add soon in the next version.
2013-07-28 20:58:30	Armageddon	[C/win 21
2013-07-28 22:23:53	 *	kirk_iowa celebrates a CLI image upload to twitter
2013-07-28 22:56:15	iam_sudip	Armageddon: Are you there?
2013-07-28 22:57:20	Armageddon	no
2013-07-28 22:57:51	iam_sudip	So, you replied! Are you busy?
2013-07-28 22:58:05	Armageddon	just ask
2013-07-28 23:00:20	iam_sudip	I am having this error when installing the code: http://fpaste.org/28456/50486591/raw/
2013-07-28 23:00:35	iam_sudip	At the end all is working well.
2013-07-28 23:01:41	iam_sudip	i mean the it happened when i was upgrading it from testpypi. the error occurs but at the it was updated and working fine.
2013-07-28 23:02:07	iam_sudip	btw, i googled.
2013-07-28 23:02:32	Armageddon	and ?
2013-07-28 23:02:37	Armageddon	when you know what the problem is lemme know :p
2013-07-28 23:02:54	iam_sudip	and found "thread" related things.
2013-07-28 23:04:04	iam_sudip	and it is new to me btw, i will read but for now i can't find where it's occurring!
2013-07-28 23:05:07	iam_sudip	can you tell me where it's occurring?
2013-07-28 23:05:43	iam_sudip	i think two threads are conflicting, i don't know, may be wrong, just asking!
2013-07-28 23:06:27	Armageddon	I'm not using to install it
2013-07-28 23:07:11	iam_sudip	sorry! meaning? i dont understand. :/
2013-07-28 23:15:07	Armageddon	I didn't make a script to install it
2013-07-28 23:16:30	iam_sudip	oh! ok.
2013-07-28 23:20:16	Armageddon	there's no need
2013-07-28 23:21:28	iam_sudip	no need for what? for making the package? noh! i just made.
2013-07-28 23:44:11	iam_sudip	It is 4.10 am. going to sleep and I love Mondays.
2013-07-28 23:58:33	J_Caselles	then, tweepy doesn't update_with_media...
