2013-07-23 14:41:28	kushal	so in today's session we will look back at what we did still now, everyone please tell what all you never liked and where/how we can improve this training ? (we have around 2 months left)
2013-07-23 14:41:38	kushal	we can do it one by one
2013-07-23 14:41:53	kushal	I will start asking nicks based on their roll call today
2013-07-23 14:42:00	kushal	please tell us in details
2013-07-23 14:42:14	kushal	rahulch, you first :)
2013-07-23 14:42:43	kushal	iam_sudip, you can start talking too :)
2013-07-23 14:44:04	rahulch	kushal, the training has been awesum I must say :D I enjoyed it a lot. Regarding the coming 2 months, I think it would be good if there were some sessions on C++, which may be useful for potential software developers :)
2013-07-23 14:44:35	kushal	rahulch, tell us what all you never liked ? not what you liked :p
2013-07-23 14:44:53	kushal	iam_sudip, any input from you ?
2013-07-23 14:44:56	rahulch	kushal, I can't find any :P
2013-07-23 14:45:06	kushal	rahulch, ok
2013-07-23 14:45:11	kushal	iam_sudip, your turn
2013-07-23 14:45:18	iam_sudip	No. I liked it.
2013-07-23 14:45:30	kushal	iam_sudip, no suggestions ?
2013-07-23 14:46:02	kushal	puspita, tenstormavi go ahead
2013-07-23 14:46:05	tenstormavi	I want some more time for long and typical home tasks because we have college also. And want a class of C. Otherwise it is all good and i am learning a lot thanks.
2013-07-23 14:46:20	iam_sudip	All things I am learning here is all new. and whatever I am learning here I found it's perfect from my point of view.
2013-07-23 14:46:45	kushal	puspita, you, any points?
2013-07-23 14:47:27	kushal	devyani, manishjain2792 any input ?
2013-07-23 14:47:48	puspita	kushal, Firstly this online training is absolutly new starting with roll call to assignment. Initally I had problem to catch up but eventually managed. I always got help from the channel whenever i required. As a whole i realy am liking this training.
2013-07-23 14:48:10	zishan	in the middle of training, when python language starts, i found quite difficulty, but it is very good for me, and i really like the training
2013-07-23 14:48:12	kushal	puspita, there must be something that you never liked!
2013-07-23 14:48:38	kushal	he suddenly talks and then vanishes
2013-07-23 14:48:50	kushal	anuragk, zishan
2013-07-23 14:49:17	devyani	kushal, i think the training is just perfect, there is nothing that i didnt like about it, rather we need to keep up with it :)
2013-07-23 14:49:18	puspita	kushal, to be honest i never liked the sarcastic comments i got, but somehow that always made me search ever doubt of mine in google before asking :) . It just made me self-dependent.
2013-07-23 14:49:33	zishan	 in the middle of training, when python language starts, i found quite difficulty, but it is very good for me, and i really like the training
2013-07-23 14:50:28	kushal	m0rin09m`, avik speak up
2013-07-23 14:50:38	anuragk	there are many things i like here. otherwise, i will want someone to explain the codes submitted for hometask. I men looking at them..
2013-07-23 14:50:46	avik	well, I am absolutely cool with this training.. Its already pretty better. I dont feel that any changes needs to be introduced. But, I must say that its a lot better and upgraded from previous year's sessions that what i got to hear from a couple of trainees of last year... Many new things and concepts has been introduced this year. I would like to say that if a short session about C and C++ could be conducted then it would have been a little better, and would
2013-07-23 14:50:47	avik	have been helpfull for those who has got a keen interest in software developing... and the rest is all good.. Thanks for everything Kushal.. and i didnt find anything to be disliked in this training. Thank You. :)
2013-07-23 14:51:24	anuragk	I feel mine was quite simple. How to think in that way.
2013-07-23 14:51:49	kushal	ok
2013-07-23 14:52:03	kushal	J_Caselles, elita15 your input
2013-07-23 14:52:52	avik	yeah i agree with anuragk. it would be a lot helpfull if the codes are explained by someone. i mean the one which are given for hometasks.
2013-07-23 14:53:06	kushal	noted
2013-07-23 14:53:13	Armageddon	!
2013-07-23 14:53:17	kushal	Armageddon, sonam input
2013-07-23 14:53:18	Armageddon	I didn't understand that point
2013-07-23 14:53:23	kushal	Armageddon, which one ?
2013-07-23 14:53:25	sonam	kushal,the session is good overall, inspite of facing some difficulty regarding git, python etc as it's all new to me. hope the session will be useful for us in future. thank you.
2013-07-23 14:53:28	Armageddon	what do  you mean codes explained by someone ?
2013-07-23 14:53:55	kushal	Armageddon, means someone will go through line by line and explains what it is doing
2013-07-23 14:53:59	kushal	or why
2013-07-23 14:54:09	J_Caselles	If I had to say something, at some point the pace was a little bit slow, but generally is difficult enought for me, so I'm happy
2013-07-23 14:54:50	kushal	ok
2013-07-23 14:54:51	Armageddon	kushal, that's what the comments are supposed to do
2013-07-23 14:55:01	kushal	Armageddon, True
2013-07-23 14:55:04	Armageddon	it's a waste of time in my opinion, I took my time to write my comments
2013-07-23 14:55:13	kushal	Armageddon, yes
2013-07-23 14:55:14	Armageddon	and everyone else should've as well, my comments took twice as much as my code took
2013-07-23 14:55:14	kavis_1	sorry kushal , for being late
2013-07-23 14:55:23	kushal	kavis_1, no problem
2013-07-23 14:55:32	elita15	kushal, the training is very good.  It also helped me become independent.  I wish we were given extra time for submitting assignments as college has started.
2013-07-23 14:55:45	m0rin09m`	it will be nice to have a review session for each assignment. so that everyone can share and understand why other people use the particular logic in their code. and comes up with the better solution. there are so many different way you can solve the problem in python. so it may help us to choose which solution is better in certain scenario.
2013-07-23 14:55:54	anuragk	kushal: I meant, the best codes to be explained. like m0rin09m` always comes up with something good.
2013-07-23 14:56:00	J_Caselles	Armageddon: also, it's a good real life practice to understand code without much comments
2013-07-23 14:56:30	Armageddon	J_Caselles, no, I agree with that, but I'm talking about this class
2013-07-23 14:56:33	kushal	Armageddon, any input from you ?
2013-07-23 14:56:46	Armageddon	well, I already gave my input previously about the losing time
2013-07-23 14:56:52	Armageddon	for example, here's what I would suggest
2013-07-23 14:56:59	Armageddon	we started by losing time over the shell
2013-07-23 14:57:15	kushal	ok
2013-07-23 14:57:15	Armageddon	that was a waste of time, people should've learned the shell before the sessions
2013-07-23 14:57:18	elita15	kushal, also it would be better if we could have guest lectures on weekends if possible as most of us are unable to attend it due to college/work when it is in the afternoons.
2013-07-23 14:57:28	Armageddon	people should've learned git before the sessions
2013-07-23 14:57:40	Armageddon	what I would suggest is to divide the sessions into topics
2013-07-23 14:57:48	supriya	supriya saha
2013-07-23 14:57:49	Armageddon	instead of one big session about python that starts with bash
2013-07-23 14:57:57	kushal	Armageddon, actually those are the part of the sessions :) we are also trying to teach them those things :)
2013-07-23 14:57:58	supriya	sorry for being late
2013-07-23 14:58:19	Armageddon	kushal, no I understand, but here's the thing, I joined thinking it would start with python
2013-07-23 14:58:25	kushal	Armageddon, I will keep in mind about diving the sessions
2013-07-23 14:58:26	Armageddon	it started with something totally different
2013-07-23 14:58:41	dot|not	kushal: But people need to be willing to learn. Not just sit in class and wait for everything being fed to them.
2013-07-23 14:58:42	kushal	Armageddon, so the message was kind of wrong , you mean
2013-07-23 14:58:43	Armageddon	for example, you can make topics, shell first, git second, etc...
2013-07-23 14:59:01	Armageddon	the advertisement was wrong
2013-07-23 14:59:03	kushal	dot|not, understood
2013-07-23 14:59:13	kushal	Armageddon, that was there in the wiki page
2013-07-23 14:59:18	kushal	I guess people missed that
2013-07-23 14:59:23	Armageddon	I did as well
2013-07-23 14:59:37	Armageddon	so if it was there, then it was my fault
2013-07-23 14:59:46	kushal	Armageddon, no, not like that
2013-07-23 15:00:10	kushal	anyway, we will discuss it in few minutes
2013-07-23 15:00:17	Armageddon	no, if I missed something that you did, then it is not your fault, it's mine
2013-07-23 15:00:35	kushal	sonam, rashmi amresh speak
2013-07-23 15:01:08	kushal	sonam, rashmi amresh ?
2013-07-23 15:01:19	sonam	kushal,the session is good overall, inspite of facing some difficulty regarding git, python etc as it's all new to me. hope the session will be useful for us in future. thank you.
2013-07-23 15:01:47	kushal	kirk_iowa, umesh
2013-07-23 15:01:54	rashmi	i just tried tried to get whatever is taught,and rest is fine about the sessions
2013-07-23 15:02:00	kirk_iowa	sorry, some of this has already been covered by others...
2013-07-23 15:02:14	kirk_iowa	what i liked:  I like the overall approach.  Using various commonly used tools as part of the course work, for example: git and irc.
2013-07-23 15:02:23	umesh	kushal, I felt that the procedure to explain things is very favourable for beginners like us, also it allows us to become self dependent.
2013-07-23 15:02:28	kirk_iowa	what i have not liked:  some paticularly detailed information might be better provided in prepared docs with *more* step-by-step usage exercises.  This might get people using those tools, that they are unfamiliar with, faster and easier (like git, shell, file system, mail list).
2013-07-23 15:02:42	kirk_iowa	suggestions: i learn best by doing excercises.  For example: typing them out and going through the processes, and seeing how they work.  We have done that in session numerous times.  I just wish that the reading assignments had *more* simple exercises to do while reading, to help learn the new concepts and build upon concepts learned earlier.
2013-07-23 15:02:47	kirk_iowa	<eof>
2013-07-23 15:03:15	kushal	kirk_iowa, ok
2013-07-23 15:03:39	kushal	kavis_1, supriya any thing you want to say ?
2013-07-23 15:03:50	kushal	Christi123, ?
2013-07-23 15:04:00	supriya	no kushal :)
2013-07-23 15:04:10	kushal	kavis_1, Christi123 ?
2013-07-23 15:04:56	kushal	anyone else wants to say anything ?
2013-07-23 15:05:03	shantanu	i liked the training. it had a good start. but i found it very hard in the later part of the python sessions. i was not able to solve and submit some tasks in time. i expected some more explainations before getting the tasks on those topics. but later on i got it from some detailed sessions on those topics. but its cool to attend it :)
2013-07-23 15:05:59	kushal	ok
2013-07-23 15:06:01	kushal	now
2013-07-23 15:06:06	kushal	about C/C++
2013-07-23 15:06:13	kushal	we tried to do C before
2013-07-23 15:06:33	kushal	but the amount of errors people keep getting is really difficult to track over irc
2013-07-23 15:06:39	kushal	same goes to C++
2013-07-23 15:07:20	kushal	and coming back to Armageddon's point
2013-07-23 15:07:42	kushal	what he said is correct about code comments
2013-07-23 15:08:25	kushal	Why I never went out to explain code ? I always wanted people to read code comments and ask the person who wrote if required
2013-07-23 15:08:36	kushal	they should not ask me as I never wrote the code
2013-07-23 15:08:43	kushal	btw, feel free to talk everyone
2013-07-23 15:08:57	kushal	I missed the comma :(
2013-07-23 15:09:01	Armageddon	!
2013-07-23 15:09:08	kushal	Armageddon, free talking now :)
2013-07-23 15:09:10	kushal	talk
2013-07-23 15:09:12	dot|not	Which leads to another problem: Nobody is here in the IRC. J_Caselles, Armageddon, piotrekkt, kirk_iowa.
2013-07-23 15:09:17	Armageddon	just to clarrify things, I've been here for a long time
2013-07-23 15:09:25	dot|not	These are the only people having conversations. (Oh, and kushal.)
2013-07-23 15:09:40	Armageddon	I've talked about code with dot|not, J_Caselles, kushal, etc...
2013-07-23 15:09:46	kirk_iowa	i have a suggestion for those that want to begin learning C (free online course). google: harvard CS50.  or "This is CS50".
2013-07-23 15:09:48	Armageddon	we've bounced ideas about code, we learned from each other etc...
2013-07-23 15:10:11	Armageddon	we always made the deadlines
2013-07-23 15:10:25	kushal	Armageddon, correct
2013-07-23 15:10:28	Armageddon	and also I managed to contribute to the book at the same time
2013-07-23 15:10:47	kushal	talking is very required
2013-07-23 15:11:32	Armageddon	coding is not about having problems, you'll ALWAYS have problems, it's about solving those problems
2013-07-23 15:12:10	Armageddon	I had to learn regex during the course to be able to do some of the stuff more easily, like searching
2013-07-23 15:12:20	Armageddon	if it required stuff I needed to learn, so be it
2013-07-23 15:12:57	dot|not	I second that. (Even though I'm the negative example.)
2013-07-23 15:13:36	Armageddon	but that's my own experience, other people might have other experiences
2013-07-23 15:14:00	Armageddon	here's the sad part I found about the sessions and I told kushal about it
2013-07-23 15:14:10	Armageddon	way back during the session
2013-07-23 15:14:34	Armageddon	there was a lot of time lost on questions during the session, so much time lost that each session took me 5 minutes to study from the logs
2013-07-23 15:14:51	Armageddon	there was 55 minutes of irrelevant questions that should've been googled
2013-07-23 15:15:16	Armageddon	and after all kushal did from the beginning and all the time and effort that he put into this
2013-07-23 15:15:16	kushal	hehe
2013-07-23 15:15:22	Armageddon	I still see people doing the same mistakes
2013-07-23 15:15:29	Armageddon	and that's disrespect to him
2013-07-23 15:15:44	Armageddon	he should be offended by every single person that does the same mistake over and over again
2013-07-23 15:16:08	Armageddon	but he's too nice of a person
2013-07-23 15:16:22	dot|not	Which is even more ashaming for the rest.
2013-07-23 15:16:23	Armageddon	that's why I know I can't be him and can't do what he did
2013-07-23 15:16:24	sonam	kirk_iowa, please tell how to register myself in that online course of CS50?
2013-07-23 15:17:03	dot|not	sonam, query him please. This is not part of the ongoing discussion.
2013-07-23 15:17:18	kushal	sonam, discuss in private
2013-07-23 15:17:19	Armageddon	if it wasn't for kushal and some of the new friends I made here and they know each other, I would've left a long time ago
2013-07-23 15:17:25	Armageddon	I couldn't stand the sessions
2013-07-23 15:17:33	kushal	Armageddon, I understand the pain
2013-07-23 15:17:36	sonam	dot|not,kushal, sorry
2013-07-23 15:17:40	kushal	s/I/ I can/
2013-07-23 15:17:41	+batul	What kushal meant to say was: Armageddon,  I can understand the pain
2013-07-23 15:17:44	Armageddon	I had to miss them on purpose, while being here and reading them after
2013-07-23 15:18:34	Armageddon	I said this before to kushal and I'm saying it again now, but that's my personal view on things and poeple might like them or they might not
2013-07-23 15:18:51	Armageddon	and btw, every single person in here is a better coder than I am
2013-07-23 15:19:04	Armageddon	most of you are computer scientists, I'm not
2013-07-23 15:19:12	dot|not	(Ignore the last two sentences.)
2013-07-23 15:19:33	Armageddon	well, I meant in theory :p
2013-07-23 15:19:44	Armageddon	in practice, things change
2013-07-23 15:19:52	kushal	kirk_iowa, btw, about your point on more exercises , do you want them in the book ?
2013-07-23 15:20:02	kushal	I mean in the Python book ?
2013-07-23 15:20:17	kirk_iowa	sonam: http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/    In the upper right hand corner you can choose a course from 2012 (link give) , 2011, etc... choose and all lectures, assignments are there.
2013-07-23 15:20:43	kirk_iowa	sonam: a good internet connection might be needed to download lecture videos, and things.
2013-07-23 15:20:57	kushal	kirk_iowa, you can tell her those in pm too
2013-07-23 15:21:12	kushal	http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ---> Everyone should read that as a next thing

2013-07-23 15:21:47	@kushal	Everyone read the tutorial
2013-07-23 15:21:59	@kushal	kirk_iowa, any answer to my question ?
2013-07-23 15:22:07	kirk_iowa	kushal: ^^ yes !
2013-07-23 15:22:18	@kushal	:)
2013-07-23 15:24:24	dot|not	Personal opinion on exercises: I've read a lot of books about programming languages in the last few years. And many of them gave you exercises like: "Peter has 3 apples, Paul has two apples and Mary has only one apple. Write a program that adds the amount of apples." - this is extremely boring and demotivating.
2013-07-23 15:24:51	dot|not	So maybe, if it's possible, try to make them more complicated or funnier (Monty Python offers a great source for humor! :D).
2013-07-23 15:25:07	dot|not	The best approach was, in my humble opinion, building a little project step by step.
2013-07-23 15:25:09	dot|not	Just my two cents.
2013-07-23 15:25:13	@kushal	dot|not, ok
2013-07-23 15:25:21	kirk_iowa	dot|not: agreed.
2013-07-23 15:25:32	@kushal	dot|not, that is the goal asay aorund 0.5 release of the book :)
2013-07-23 15:26:07	dot|not	Great. :)
2013-07-23 15:26:32	kirk_iowa	dot|not: kushal  i think Zed Shaw does this pretty well, while remaining humerous enough that the exercises aren't too tedious.
2013-07-23 15:26:56	@kushal	kirk_iowa, yes, I liked his approach
2013-07-23 15:27:04	dot|not	Oh yeah. Learn Python / Learn C the hard way are pretty cool.
2013-07-23 15:27:14	kirk_iowa	^^ yes
2013-07-23 15:28:51	kirk_iowa	I am actually do his side by side with this course, as it helps me (as I am new  and slow with Object Oriented programming)  :)
2013-07-23 15:29:12	@kushal	kirk_iowa, ok :)
2013-07-23 15:30:33	@kushal	dot|not, actually I wanted to see how people are reacting to the small problem we are giving as hometasks ?
2013-07-23 15:30:44	@kushal	based on that I wanted to add a project details
2013-07-23 15:32:54	dot|not	I'd say the reception has been pretty good overall. Most people seem to be happy with the given exercises.
2013-07-23 15:33:01	 *	dot|not glances at the rest of the users in here.
2013-07-23 15:33:29	@kushal	dot|not, I think many found them difficult
2013-07-23 15:33:34	@kushal	and of course
2013-07-23 15:34:02	dot|not	It's "difficult" versus "too difficult". The first one is not bad I'd say.
2013-07-23 15:34:34	@kushal	who all said that the colleges started and they don't have time, I am not going to trust those line
2013-07-23 15:34:37	@kushal	* lines
2013-07-23 15:34:37	J_Caselles	difficult is/should be compeling
2013-07-23 15:35:06	@kushal	though I was a student 8 years back but I still visit college hostels
2013-07-23 15:35:17	anuragk	dot|not yes, they were not that difficult
2013-07-23 15:35:17	@kushal	and I know how much time a student gets
2013-07-23 15:35:25	@kushal	J_Caselles, dot|not :)
2013-07-23 15:36:55	dot|not	Glad I'm not a student anymore. :P I never made a secret of me being less dedicated than I could possibly be. But being this I'd had to sacrifice a lot of things I'm not willing to sacrifice. So I took and take the most out of everything.
2013-07-23 15:37:28	dot|not	And I'm fine with that so far. I don't thing I'm an annoyance for anyone. (If so, I'd be happily expelled / kickbanned. :))
2013-07-23 15:37:48	Armageddon	dot|not, you are leave !

2013-07-23 15:40:18	tenstormavi	kushal, now it is different here. Did you ever heard about prayers in the morning in college?? But now it is going in our college.
2013-07-23 15:40:51	@kushal	tenstormavi, does not matter
2013-07-23 15:41:02	@kushal	tenstormavi, you still have enough time
2013-07-23 15:41:17	iam_sudip	yes it is true. we have enough time. if someone seriously give time to study even they have the time to do the assignments given here. I also think it is an excuse..
2013-07-23 15:42:44	tenstormavi	And attendence is also compulsory, so we have to attend our classes till 5:30 pm.
2013-07-23 15:42:58	@kushal	tenstormavi, and our session starts at 7pm
2013-07-23 15:43:47	@kushal	tenstormavi, point is, if you want to attend, you will make your own time
2013-07-23 15:44:02	Armageddon	for me, some of the sessions were at 7am
2013-07-23 15:44:11	tenstormavi	kushal, i am not complaining about session. I just say we were given more time for home tasks.
2013-07-23 15:44:12	Armageddon	and all the rest are at 9:30am
2013-07-23 15:44:42	@kushal	Armageddon, correct :)
2013-07-23 15:45:01	Armageddon	and I still attended
2013-07-23 15:45:20	Armageddon	if you want to learn something, you have to sacrifice
2013-07-23 15:45:22	kirk_iowa	Man that one was at 6:00 AM for me...
2013-07-23 15:45:26	dot|not	You don't need sleep. Zombies have it easier.
2013-07-23 15:45:32	dot|not	(@ Armageddon :P)
2013-07-23 15:45:47	kirk_iowa	Stupid Time warner cable was out that morning though...
2013-07-23 15:45:48	Armageddon	and for the home tasks, they didn't take much time
2013-07-23 15:46:14	@kushal	I can understand points of having more steps given
2013-07-23 15:46:15	iam_sudip	Armageddon: +1.
2013-07-23 15:46:16	kirk_iowa	Armageddon: most... I struggle for a long time on one though. :)
2013-07-23 15:46:17	Armageddon	took me an hour to do each, while contributing to the book, learning it, learning python, searching what I need to get the job done and writing the code
2013-07-23 15:46:54	Armageddon	and took me 2 hours to nag to myself about commenting it :p
2013-07-23 15:48:12	@kushal	anyway, another task
2013-07-23 15:49:19	@kushal	use google.com to find out how to add package dependencies in your setup.py project
2013-07-23 15:49:26	@kushal	s/project/file/
2013-07-23 15:49:27	+batul	What kushal meant to say was: use google.com to find out how to add package dependencies in your setup.py file
2013-07-23 15:50:10	@kushal	and create a new project, make that setup.py and other files properly, submit it to the test PyPI server (remember, the test server)
2013-07-23 15:50:48	 *	kirk_iowa thinks, Oh No.
2013-07-23 15:50:58	@kushal	and then submit a home task post with the link of the project in test PyPi
2013-07-23 15:51:21	@kushal	title of the post: "dummy project"
2013-07-23 15:51:26	@kushal	btw, missed one point
2013-07-23 15:52:07	@kushal	in the dummy project, one should have a command myshell (remember that shell I asked to write few days back ?)
2013-07-23 15:53:01	@kushal	remember to test the project using pip :)
2013-07-23 15:53:05	@kushal	any questions ?
2013-07-23 15:53:09	Armageddon	!
2013-07-23 15:53:43	J_Caselles	!
2013-07-23 15:54:47	@kushal	Armageddon, J_Caselles ask
2013-07-23 15:54:50	Armageddon	what test server ?
2013-07-23 15:54:57	@kushal	Armageddon, PyPi test server

2013-07-23 15:56:27	Armageddon	hmm, kool
2013-07-23 15:56:39	@kushal	so everyone needs to do more searching this time
2013-07-23 15:56:58	@kushal	as they have to find out few stuffs in setup.py which is not written in the book :)
2013-07-23 15:57:16	anuragk	!
2013-07-23 15:57:16	@kushal	you have 2 days for the submission :)

2013-07-23 15:59:11	anuragk	which we wrote ?
2013-07-23 16:00:07	@kushal	anuragk, yes, few days back
2013-07-23 16:00:19	anuragk	ok.
2013-07-23 16:00:20	@kushal	remember to rename the file myshell.py myshell
2013-07-23 16:00:25	@kushal	remember to rename the file myshell.py to myshell
2013-07-23 16:00:27	@kushal	elita15, ask
2013-07-23 16:03:09	elita15	same doubt as anuragk. now cleared.

2013-07-23 16:20:58	@kushal	in last one year I spoke 8k lines, in around a month Armageddon spoke 3k :)
2013-07-23 16:21:35	Armageddon	lol
2013-07-23 16:22:35	@kushal	anyone finished reading the link ?
2013-07-23 16:24:25	elita15	kushal, in project structure it was said that the account details are stored in .pypirc file in home directory..are we supposed to create the file with the  given contents?
2013-07-23 16:26:15	@kushal	elita15, this question proves that you never read that chapter before
2013-07-23 16:26:34	@kushal	I thought I asked people to read that before
2013-07-23 16:26:49	@kushal	not answering your question, sorry
2013-07-23 16:29:50	@kushal	also read How to become a hacker -- http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html

2013-07-23 16:31:54	@kushal	kirk_iowa, any comments ?
2013-07-23 16:34:10	elita15	kushal, i did read the chapter but i could not find .pypirc file
2013-07-23 16:34:28	kirk_iowa	i don't know if it is world wide, or just america.  But this is the trend in all fields in colleges.  The school believes it's true function is to preserve the school, not challenge students.  They want more and more students (more and more tuition dollars)... they don't care if the graduates can handle work in the real world or not.
2013-07-23 16:34:48	@kushal	kirk_iowa, same everywhere
2013-07-23 16:35:04	@kushal	kirk_iowa, like in India we just produce lots of people with CSE degrees
2013-07-23 16:36:45	elita15	kushal, i am sorry i read the chapter the same day you told but was stuck at that point when i tried to follow the instructions.i shall read it again and figure out.
2013-07-23 16:37:15	kirk_iowa	i took a course in college.  Chem 102B.  "Organic chemistry for the biology major".  After a test, the teacher would go throug th test, question by question.
2013-07-23 16:38:12	kirk_iowa	If a big enough group (varied) of students answered a question wrong, and whined enough.  The teacher would allow the incorrect answer to be counted as correct.
2013-07-23 16:39:36	kirk_iowa	I set the curve on those tests, before adjustments for incorrect answers.  And I dropped out at the end of the semester.  Man, I hate school.
2013-07-23 16:41:34	kirk_iowa	Higher education is becoming nothing but a toll booth that you have no choice to pay the ever increasing toll.  Degrees are bought, not earned.
2013-07-23 16:42:58	@kushal	in US one good thing may be about people getting in any school with money, but it is not sure that they will pass
2013-07-23 16:44:07	kirk_iowa	kushal: depends on the school :)
2013-07-23 16:44:08	@kushal	like in MIT

2013-07-23 17:01:26	@kushal	ok
2013-07-23 17:03:17	 *	rahulch goes for dinner
2013-07-23 17:03:58	Armageddon	and I don't totally agree with the second guy
2013-07-23 17:04:02	Armageddon	let me explain why
2013-07-23 17:04:18	Armageddon	when I talked to you about python using pointers and you said no it doesn't
2013-07-23 17:04:30	Armageddon	in reality, a = b is pointing a to the address of
2013-07-23 17:04:32	Armageddon	b
2013-07-23 17:05:13	Armageddon	yes, on the upper level of the language, there are no pointers but in reality and under the hood that's all it's doing it's *a = b or a = &b
2013-07-23 17:06:21	Armageddon	you might not use or want to use a language like C for major coding for example or in a business BUT it doesn't mean that what C taught you will not affect your style of coding and way of thinking
2013-07-23 17:06:49	Armageddon	so yes, some languages make you a better coder, less lazy, etc... even thought you might not use them or want to use them
2013-07-23 17:07:38	piotrektt	hey all. sorry for being late.
2013-07-23 17:08:19	piotrektt	oh session is over :P - btw. is second session today?
2013-07-23 17:08:27	Armageddon	piotrektt, don't worry, you were only 2 hours late
2013-07-23 17:08:47	piotrektt	hehe :)
2013-07-23 17:08:53	Armageddon	:p
2013-07-23 17:08:55	@kushal	Armageddon, pointers is not a language feature
2013-07-23 17:09:04	piotrektt	i had the chat on, but couldn't attend :(
2013-07-23 17:09:19	Armageddon	kushal, you're missing the point :p
2013-07-23 17:09:53	Armageddon	by simply knowing that a = b is assigning the pointer a to the address of b explains everything to me
2013-07-23 17:10:21	Armageddon	and I'm talking under the hood, NOT on the higher language level
2013-07-23 17:10:33	@kushal	Armageddon, :)
2013-07-23 17:10:56	Armageddon	I made that mistake in a code and I was having the same output twice
2013-07-23 17:11:00	Armageddon	I did a = b = 0
2013-07-23 17:11:06	Armageddon	which I used to do in other langauges
2013-07-23 17:11:14	Armageddon	then when I had the same output for a and b
2013-07-23 17:11:28	Armageddon	I thought of it as pointers, everything unraveled
2013-07-23 17:15:46	kirk_iowa	finished lisp artice (read hacker article a couple years ago)
2013-07-23 17:15:51	kirk_iowa	finished lisp article (read hacker article a couple years ago)
2013-07-23 17:19:00	@kushal	kirk_iowa, ok
2013-07-23 17:19:45	@kushal	kirk_iowa, any comments
2013-07-23 17:19:52	@kushal	Armageddon, I understood your problem
2013-07-23 17:21:23	kirk_iowa	my brother wants me to read a book about lisp.  Can't find the title (he thinks lisp might be something i would be interested in)....
2013-07-23 17:21:39	 *	kirk_iowa needs more organization
2013-07-23 17:23:50	 *	kirk_iowa gives up looking through old emails...
2013-07-23 17:25:25	kirk_iowa	anyway.  he is at work, so it might be a while before he responds to me.
2013-07-23 17:26:27	@kushal	kirk_iowa, there are few awesome books
2013-07-23 17:26:37	kirk_iowa	he thinks that for some reason that lisp might be good match for me.  as I am not experienced with any language really.
2013-07-23 17:27:08	@kushal	kirk_iowa, then it should be
2013-07-23 17:27:17	@kushal	http://landoflisp.com/ is the funniest way to learn the language
2013-07-23 17:27:23	kirk_iowa	but the article kind of highlights what he told me.  It isn't widely used, is very unique, and very powerful.
2013-07-23 17:27:58	@kushal	kirk_iowa, yes and you can use the ideas in other places
2013-07-23 17:28:06	@kushal	like what I try to do in my python code
2013-07-23 17:29:45	kirk_iowa	one other problem with lisp though.
2013-07-23 17:30:04	kirk_iowa	no courses on #dgplug.
2013-07-23 17:31:02	rockworldmi	hi
2013-07-23 17:31:40	@kushal	kirk_iowa, hehe
2013-07-23 17:31:48	@kushal	kirk_iowa, buy and read that book
2013-07-23 17:31:52	@kushal	more than enough
2013-07-23 17:32:02	@kushal	and then you can go to other bigger books
2013-07-23 17:33:35	kirk_iowa	kushal: will first try the library (i need to get a library card in Charlotte anyway... this is a good excuse to go)
2013-07-23 17:36:06	 *	kirk_iowa is going to start reading about packaging python right now though.
2013-07-23 17:45:07	kirk_iowa	kushal: still there ?
2013-07-23 17:46:10	@kushal	yes
2013-07-23 17:47:03	kirk_iowa	kushal: nevermind.  i will just experiment, and see if i answer my own question.  :) thanks.
2013-07-23 17:47:11	@kushal	kirk_iowa, :)
2013-07-23 18:23:16	 *	kirk_iowa celebrates the existence factorial_kirk on PyPI
